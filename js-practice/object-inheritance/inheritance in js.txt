constructor inheritance::
	built-in constructor such as array and object, 
	custom constructor.
	constructor is useful to create multiple objects with same properties.

prototype inheritance::
	prototype use to add new properties and method to a constructor function.
	an object has a number of properties and a parent property, (__protp__)
	a constructor creates objects and has an associated prototype object, which is simply another object.
	when object created, parent set to the prototype object.
	declaring methods on the prototype is more memory and time efficient.
	need not to re-declaring any method to create new object.  

factory function inheritance::
	  

prototype chain::
	when a method invoke with a new object, 1st check it's own peoperties then in it's prototype properties after that it's check parents properties and prototype. 

*The call() allows for a function/method belonging to one object to be assigned and called for a different object.
