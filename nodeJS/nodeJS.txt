Node.js application consists of three important components -
	Import required modules - We use the require directive to load Node.js modules.
	Create server - A server which will listen to client's requests similar to Apache HTTP Server.
	Read request and return response - The server created in an earlier step will read the HTTP request made by the client 
	which can be a browser or a console and return the response.

use the require directive to load the http module and store the returned HTTP instance into an http variable.
use the created http instance and call http.createServer() method to create a server instance and then bind it at port 8081 
using the listen method associated with the server instance. Pass it a function with parameters request and response. 
Write the sample implementation to always return "Hello World".

REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop
	Read - Reads user's input, parses the input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.
	Eval - Takes and evaluates the data structure.
	Print - Prints the result.
	Loop - Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl-c twice.

event loop::
	// Import events module
	var events = require('events');
	
	// Create an eventEmitter object
	var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

	// Bind event and event  handler as follows
	eventEmitter.on('eventName', eventHandler);
	
	// Fire an event 
	eventEmitter.emit('eventName');
