Directory tree::
	To access a directory, use the "opendir()" function. It’s prototyped in the dirent.h header file.
	After opening the directory and doing whatever, need to use the "closedir()" function to close the directory.
	
	struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp);

	Structure variable "dirent" is a pointer that contains information about a specific entry read from a directory, 
	referenced by the "DIR" pointer used in the "readdir()" function. 
	"dirent" structure is customized based on the file system.
	key member worthy of access is "d_name", which represent the directory entry’s filename.
	"d_name" structure member used to rading a directory.

File-size::
	fseek() is used to move file pointer associated with a given file to a specific position.
	ftell() in C is used to find out the position of file pointer in the file with respect to starting of the file.
	Using fseek(), move file pointer to end, 
	then using ftell(), find its position which is actually size in bytes.
